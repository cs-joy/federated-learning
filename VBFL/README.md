# VBFL (simulation)

## Introduction
VBFL is a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain-based Federated Learning framework with a validation scheme robust against the distorted local model updates. This repo hosts an simulated implementation for VBFL written in Python.

Please refer to [*Robust Blockchained Federated Learning with Model Validation and Proof-of-Stake Inspired Consensus*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03300) for detailed explanations of the mechanisms. This [*video*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMseEXEITvw&t=4510s&ab_channel=HangChen) is about my talk of VBFL.
